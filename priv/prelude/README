This directory is the Gradualizer prelude. It is used to define and override
types and specs in modules from OTP.

Most of the overrides are replacing term() with any() in specs, because in OTP,
they are considered synonyms but in Gradualizer, they are not. Another common
correction is overriding a spec such as foo(term()) -> term() with a polymorphic
one such as foo(A) -> A.

For more information about the gradual type system, see the manual.
